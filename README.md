# Intelligibility Enhancement
Three different methods for intelligibility enhancement are considered and implemented in matlab.
The results are analyzed by the short time objective intelligibility measure (STOI) and speech
intelligibility in bits (SIIB). The following intelligibility enhancing algorithms are considered

* Frequency compensation by algebra?cally optimizing for SIIB_Gauss
* Lombard effect
* Transient amplification
