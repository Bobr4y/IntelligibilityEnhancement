# Intelligibility Enhancement
Three different methods for intelligibility enhancement are considered and implemented in matlab.
The results are analyzed using speech intelligibility in bits (SIIB). The following intelligibility enhancing algorithms are considered

* Frequency compensation by algebraical optimization for SIIB_Gauss
* Lombard algorithm
* Transient amplification
